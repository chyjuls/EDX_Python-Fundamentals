# The United States Social Security Administration publishes
# a list of all documented baby names each year, along with
# how often each name was used for boys and for girls. The
# list is used to see what names are most common in a given
# year.
#
# We've grabbed that data for any name used more than 25
# times, and provided it to you in a file called
# babynames.csv. The line below will open the file:

# We've also provided a sample subset of the data in
# sample.csv.
#
# Each line of the file has three values, separated by
# commas. The first value is the name; the second value is
# the number of times the name was given in the 2010s (so
# far); and the third value is whether that count
# corresponds to girls or boys. Note that if a name is
# given to both girls and boys, it is listed twice: for
# example, so far in the 2010s, the name Jamie has been
# given to 611 boys and 1545 girls.
