# - is_celsius, a boolean
#

#
# Note, however, that is_celsius should be an optional
# argument. If the function call does not supply a value for
# is_celsius, assume it is True.
#

#

# freezing.

    # only one of the three parts needs to be True for the
    # statement as a whole to be True:
    #
    # - If weather is snowy, then the statement is True.
    # - If temperature is less than 0, then it doesn't matter
    #   if we're in Celsius or Fahrenheit: both are freezing,
    #   so the statement is True.
    # - If temperature is less than 32 and we're in Fahrenheit,
    #   then the statement is True.
    #
    # If all of those things are False, the statement is False.
    # So, we just return the result of that expression.
